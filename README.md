======
This is a Java implementation of the Hypixel API.

Java documentation can be found mostly in the code or [JavaDocs](https://api.hypixel.net/javadocs/).

### Query Limitations
The API server has a request limit of 120 queries per minute. Abuse of the API will lead to your API key being banned.

### Obtaining an API Key
You can obtain an API key by joining ```mc.hypixel.net``` with a valid Minecraft account and running the /api command. You will then be assigned a unique key that is to remain **private**.

You can run /api again to regenerate a new key if ever necessary. This will replace the previous key.

* Google Gson library
