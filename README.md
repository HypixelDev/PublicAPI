### Query Limitations
The API server has a request limit of 120 queries per minute. Abuse of the API will lead to your API key being banned.
Examples of abuse include, but are not necessarily limited to:
- Using multiple API keys for a single application.
- Using the Hypixel API to assist in violating server rules.
- Using the Hypixel API with malintent.

If you require a higher limit than the above you can open a support ticket at https://support.hypixel.net and provide your use case and why you require a higher limit.

### Obtaining an API Key
You can obtain an API key by joining ```mc.hypixel.net``` with a valid Minecraft account and running the /api command. You will then be assigned a unique key that is to remain **private**.

### Dependencies

* Google Gson library
* Apache HttpClient

### Bug Reporting
