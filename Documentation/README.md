# Hypixel API Documentation
The Hypixel API Documentation on Github didn't have much detail, so here's a web version.

## Information

### Parameters
In this documentation, a table of parameters are HTTP GET parameters.

### API Key
Your API key can be generated by typing `/api` on the network.

### Date and Time  
Generally dates are stored as a Unix Epoch times in milliseconds.

### Response Format  
API Responses are served in JSON format.

### UUID Parameters
All UUID parameters are expected to have the UUID without dashes.

### SkyBlock items and inventories
Items and inventory data are stored as a base64 encoded string containing gzipped nbt data.
If a method is missing important information about an item or inventory, you should try checking this!
>Note: the base64 string may contain a unicode escape for non-alphabetical symbols (i.e. `=` will be displayed as `\u003d`), and some programming languages may have silent defects when interpreting the string.
