### Weapon Field Descriptions

| spec.playerClass | The weapon's class. More information is provided below. |
| material | The material of the weapon. Used to reference it's rarity and name. |

### Player Classes
Each player class is assigned a unique ID (they should never overlap.) This is used to lookup data associated with the class (such as specializations.)

| 1 | Warrior |
| 2 | Paladin |
| 3 | Shaman |

### Specializations by Player Class
Each specialization is assigned a unique ID (relative to it's parent class.) In order to know which specialization any ID is assigned to, you must know the ID of the class.
